## Get a Private Key

You can get a private key from a wallet provider [such as Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).


## Add your Private Key as an Environment Variable

Add your private key as an environment variable by running this command:

 ```
export PRIVATE_KEY='abcdef'
```

If you use a .env file, don't commit and push any changes to .env files that may contain sensitive information, such as a private key! If this information reaches a public GitHub repository, someone can use it to check if you have any Mainnet funds in that wallet address, and steal them!
